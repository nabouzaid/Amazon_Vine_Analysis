## Summary

This dataset does not indicate whether there is a bias to paid reviews because of the lack of paid reviews. A different dataset would be required to determine a bias in review type based on the review in this dataset. However, the ratio of helpful votes to total votes by star rating could provide an indication of the quality of the review with an appropriately balanced dataset. A low proportion of helpful votes on paid reviews  would indicate a bias in paid reviews.
